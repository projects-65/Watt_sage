# Household Energy Consumption Prediction:
## Project Overview
The Household Energy Consumption Prediction project aims to forecast energy usage in households based on user-specific details such as appliance usage patterns and historical energy consumption data. The project leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate energy consumption predictions, enabling users to optimize their energy usage and reduce costs.

## Technologies Used
- Python (3.8+)
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Streamlit (for the web application)
- Azure (for deployment)

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/projects-65/Watt_sage.git
